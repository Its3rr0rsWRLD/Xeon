# Xeon

A universal Roblox script hub built with Rayfield UI that dynamically loads scripts from this repository.

## Quick Start with Xeon Hub

Execute this in your favorite Roblox executor:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/Xeon/main/source.lua'))()
```

> **Note:** This is the hub, not the miscellaneous scripts. The hub automatically detects the game you're playing and loads the appropriate scripts. Miscellaneous scripts can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/Xeon/tree/main/scripts/misc/README.md) folder.

## Features

- **Dynamic Script Loading** - Automatically scans the repository for available game scripts
- **Modern UI** - Clean Rayfield interface with organized tabs and categories  
- **Game Detection** - Shows scripts available for your current game
- **Universal Tools** - Anti-AFK and other cross-game utilities
- **Easy Navigation** - Browse all supported games with search and categorization

## Currently Supported Games

The hub automatically loads scripts for these games:
- Blob Eating Simulator (17240213780)
- Pyramid Eaters (19005776777) 
- Eat Pizza Simulator (16426855766)
- And more...

*Scripts are added regularly - the hub will show newly supported games automatically*

## How It Works

1. **Current Game Tab** - Shows scripts available for the game you're currently playing
2. **All Games Tab** - Browse all supported games, organized by category
3. **Xeon Hub** - Universal tools that work across multiple games
4. **Settings** - Customize themes and hub behavior

## Notes

- All scripts use modern Rayfield UI for consistency
- Game ID validation prevents scripts from running on wrong games
- Repository structure allows easy addition of new game scripts
- No external dependencies beyond Rayfield UI library
